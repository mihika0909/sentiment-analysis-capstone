# Sentiment Analysis System (Capstone Project)

## Project Overview
This project implements an NLP-based Sentiment Analysis System that classifies text as positive or negative. 
The system compares traditional machine learning models with deep learning and integrates sentiment detection into a simple chatbot.

## Dataset
- IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset
- Each review is labeled as **positive** or **negative**
- Dataset file: `sentiment.csv`

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## Models Implemented
- Naïve Bayes (TF-IDF)
- Logistic Regression (TF-IDF)
- LSTM Neural Network

---

## Project Workflow
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF)
2. Model training and evaluation
3. Accuracy comparison
4. Confusion matrix visualization
5. Sentiment-based chatbot implementation
